# Exercise Movement Prediction 
This repository contains a collection of files used in building a prediction model for exercise movement. The training dataset and testing dataset used in building and testing the model is derived from [groupware](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har). 

The following are the exact links to the data sets:

- Training Dataset: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)
- Testing Dataset: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv)

Below is a concise description of the list of files in the repository:

1. **prediction.Rmd:** Rmd file containing the step-by-step writeup in building the prediction model for predicting exercise movement. It contains snippets of R codes used in building the prediction model.

2. **prediction.html:** html file generated from the Rmd file using R Studio for web readibility

3. **prediction.pdf:** pdf file generated from the Rmd file using R Studio for printout or paper-based readibility

3. **README.md:** this file which provides a concise description of each of the files in the repository.
